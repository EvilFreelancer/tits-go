# The T.I.T.S Project - Implemented on Go

A small project, created just4lulz, for study of the basics of working with a beautiful language called Golang.

You can see my [stream entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfUO8zgjmo8) on YouTube if you are interested in how I
worked on this project.

Target: Create a two-dimensional array and display it on the screen via cycle.

## How to use

To begin with, you will need to install a translator of the Go language, you can find it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

    git clone git@github.com:EvilFreelancer/tits-go.git
    cd tits-go
    go run tits.go

## Other

You can find a good documentation about Golang [here](https://gobyexample.com/).
